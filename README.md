This project is a comprehensive and fully functional e-commerce web application designed to deliver a 
smooth, user-friendly, and efficient shopping experience for customers while equipping administrators 
with advanced tools for managing products, orders, and user engagement. The platform addresses the 
challenges of traditional e-commerce systems by leveraging cutting-edge web technologies, secure 
authentication protocols, and dynamic inventory management capabilities.
Built on a robust technological stack comprising Angular 16 (frontend), Spring Boot 3 and Spring Security 
6 (backend), and MySQL (database), this platform aims to enhance the overall shopping experience by 
providing intuitive navigation, secure access, efficient cart operations, and real-time analytics.
The key focus of the project is on improving both customer experience and administrative control 
through the following:
• JWT-based authentication and authorization to secure access.
• Real-time analytics and product insights for admins.
• Advanced shopping features, including a dynamic cart system, a functional Wishlist, and 
enhanced product review handling.
